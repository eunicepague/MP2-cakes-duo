            'How to Bake It' emerged from our shared passion for baking, which
            we've cultivated over the years. Russell and Eunice, lifelong
            friends and avid home bakers, often found themselves swapping
            recipes, experimenting with flavors, and delighting in the joys of
            creating sweet treats. One evening, as we whipped up a batch of our
            favorite cookies, we realized how much we cherished these moments
            and the satisfaction that came from sharing our baked creations with
            family and friends. That lightbulb moment led us to establish 'How
            to Bake It' just last year, in our own kitchens. Our goal was
            simple: to create a warm and welcoming online space where we could
            document our baking adventures, share our tried-and-true recipes,
            and offer valuable tips and techniques. 'How to Bake It' quickly
            became our platform to spread the joy of baking far and wide. Since
            then, our love for all things sweet has grown stronger, and we're
            excited to continue this journey with you. Join us as we explore the
            world of baking together, one recipe at a time. Thank you for being
            a part of our baking family!
